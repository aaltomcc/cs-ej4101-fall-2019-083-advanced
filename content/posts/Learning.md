## learned 083
+ First of all, I learned the basic concepts of DevOps software practices and some of the tools used in DevOps. I learned more about the software development life cycle and why automation is important part of software development.
+ The project was probably the best way to learn these things. I have done website with React in similar method as the course project. Deploying the project with Github gh-pages was not new for me, but making deployment pipeline with Travis CI was. I am definitely going to use Travis CI for my own projects, because it helps to deploy React website without using the development computer for doing this.
+ YAML file was new thing for me. I had a lot of problems to get working yaml file for Travis. I also learned to use Github tokens. It took a few hours to get the pipeline working.
+ Using Hugo for creating websites was new to me. It felt like it is very good tool and I could make beautiful websites very fast, but I learned that making customizations to themes is very hard. I first downloaded a theme where I could not even create “About” section to the landing page. The only way was to override index.html file and that probably would not have been the idea of Hugo usage. So, I had to download another theme. I think that I will continue my website creating with actual code, because I want to customize things a lot.
+ I think that the hardest part of the course for me was to find information about customizing Hugo templates.
