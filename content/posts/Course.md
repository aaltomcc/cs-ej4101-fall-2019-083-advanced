# this course 083
+ The main reason to take the course Introduction to DevOps, was to gain knowledge about the basic principles of DevOps. I have heard lots of terms and technologies about DevOps and I wanted to get brief explanations for ideology.
+ The project about continuous deployment sounded like interesting and I wanted to learn how to do that in practice. I was thinking that I would learn to create continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines, and understand why such technologies are used.
+ I also wanted to see how the creation of websites with Hugo works. I had never heard of Hugo and it seemed like very easy way to create websites. My first thoughts were that how modifiable the code if templates are used and the idea is to create websites with markdown.
+ I thought that I could expand my knowledge with usage of pipelines in git. The main idea was that I could use the same methods for my React based single-page app.
+ I wanted to learn what CAMS model is and what the Culture, Automation, Monitoring and Sharing means in it. I have read about Lean software development and I have completed software engineering course, so I was thinking that knowing more about DevOps would expand my thoughts about developing software.
+ These are mostly the aspects why I decided to take the course. My expectations are quite clear, I wanted to learn more and using 1 student credit (27 hours) of time to this while doing my masterâ€™s thesis sounded like a good idea.
