      <description>this course 083  The main reason to take the course Introduction to DevOps, was to gain knowledge about the basic principles of DevOps. I have heard lots of terms and technologies about DevOps and I wanted to get brief explanations for ideology. The project about continuous deployment sounded like interesting and I wanted to learn how to do that in practice. I was thinking that I would learn to create continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines, and understand why such technologies are used.</description>
