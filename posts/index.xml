      <description>this course 083  The main reason to take the course Introduction to DevOps, was to gain knowledge about the basic principles of DevOps. I have heard lots of terms and technologies about DevOps and I wanted to get brief explanations for ideology. The project about continuous deployment sounded like interesting and I wanted to learn how to do that in practice. I was thinking that I would learn to create continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines, and understand why such technologies are used.</description>

      <description>learned 083  First of all, I learned the basic concepts of DevOps software practices and some of the tools used in DevOps. I learned more about the software development life cycle and why automation is important part of software development. The project was probably the best way to learn these things. I have done website with React in similar method as the course project. Deploying the project with Github gh-pages was not new for me, but making deployment pipeline with Travis CI was.</description>
