# About




At the moment, I am working as a masterâ€™s thesis worker. My thesis subject is related to quality of transmission system forecasts. I have mostly worked with data analysis and software engineering during my studies. At the moment, I want to expand my knowledge with cloud services such as Azure. I am interested in developing machine learning algorithms and I want to learn how to deploy neural networks in cloud services such as Azure Devops. In addition, I am interested in microservices such as docker. Working with software is very interesting because the technology is changing so rapidly. After my studies are finished I would like to work with software and data.
